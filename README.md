# unpkg

[unpkg](https://unpkg.com) is a fast, global CDN for everything on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

The project is sponsored by [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) and [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

## Development

To start the server, use `yarn dev`. This will start the backend so the website (which is really just a static HTML file) can serve as a proxy for package requests. Then, start the app in another shell with `yarn start`.
